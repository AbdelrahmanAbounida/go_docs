>> In general, Go module keeps track of the dependencies in files named go.mod and go.sum

>> go.sum is automatically generated and derived from go.mod, so you typically never need to do anything directly to that file

>> go.mod = package.json , go.sum = package-lock.json

>> to create a module:
>> go mod init  github.com/AbdelrahmanAbounida/go_docs #  it initializes the current directory as a Go module directory

>> to install dependency
go get -u -d github/.. 

>> when something looks off
go mod tidy



>> general steps:

(1) go mod init your_repo_name/ desired_module_name
(2) go mod tidy
